## Real-World Ski Racing

- Types:
  - Slalom (SL)
    - Slalom is a timed event requiring the execution of many short, quick turns through two different courses
  - Giant Slalom (GS)
    - skiers race down the mountain through a faster and more open course than in Slalom. Giant slalom is similar to the slalom, with fewer, but wider and smoother turns. Each skier makes two runs down two different courses on the same slope. Both runs take place on the same day, usually with the first run held in the morning and the second run in the afternoon. The times are added together, and the fastest total time determines the winner.
  - Super-G (SG)
    - (super giant slalom)
  - Downhill (DH)
  - Derbie (U12, U14, U16)
